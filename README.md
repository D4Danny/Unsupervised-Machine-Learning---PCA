# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning---PCA
Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA is a linear orthogonal transformation, which extracts low dimensional set of features from a high dimensional data set with a motive to capture as much information as possible. With fewer variables, VISUALIZATION also becomes much more meaningful.  PCA is more useful when dealing with 3 or higher dimensional data.
